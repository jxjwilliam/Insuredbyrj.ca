  "faq": {
    "coverageAmount": {
      "question": "How much life insurance do I need?",
      "answer": "A good rule of thumb is to have coverage worth 10-12 times your annual income. However, the right amount depends on your specific situation—including debts, dependents, income replacement needs, and future goals like college funding. Our free quote tool will help you calculate a personalized recommendation based on your unique circumstances."
    },
    "termVsWhole": {
      "question": "What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
      "answer": "**Term life** covers you for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) and is typically more affordable. It's perfect for covering temporary needs like a mortgage or raising children. **Whole life** provides lifetime coverage and builds cash value over time, but costs more. Think of term as \"renting\" and whole life as \"buying\" your insurance."
    },
    "healthImpact": {
      "question": "Will my health affect my life insurance rates?",
      "answer": "Yes, your health, age, and lifestyle all impact your premium rates. That's why it's best to apply when you're younger and healthier. However, even if you have pre-existing conditions, you can still get coverage—you may just pay slightly higher rates. We work with multiple insurers to find you the best rates regardless of your health situation."
    },
    "coverageSpeed": {
      "question": "How quickly can I get covered?",
      "answer": "For simplified issue policies (no medical exam), you can get coverage in as little as 24-48 hours. For fully underwritten policies that require a medical exam, the process typically takes 2-4 weeks. We'll guide you through every step and work to get you approved as quickly as possible."
    },
    "taxImplications": {
      "question": "Are life insurance payouts taxable in Canada?",
      "answer": "No! Life insurance death benefits are generally tax-free in Canada. Your beneficiaries receive the full payout without owing income tax on it. This makes life insurance one of the most tax-efficient ways to transfer wealth and protect your family's financial future."
    },
    "cancellation": {
      "question": "Can I cancel my policy if my situation changes?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can cancel your life insurance policy at any time. Most policies have a 10-day \"free look\" period where you can cancel for a full refund. After that, you can still cancel, though you won't receive a refund for term policies. For whole life or universal life policies with cash value, you may be entitled to receive the surrender value. We're always here to discuss your options if your needs change."
    },
    "claimsProcess": {
      "question": "How do I file a life insurance claim?",
      "answer": "Filing a life insurance claim is straightforward. **Contact us immediately** at 778-830-0142 or infinity@insureline.com when you need to file a claim. We'll guide you through the process and provide all necessary claim forms. You'll need the original death certificate, completed claim form, policy documents, and beneficiary identification. Most claims are processed within 2-4 weeks, and once approved, the death benefit is paid directly to beneficiaries tax-free."
