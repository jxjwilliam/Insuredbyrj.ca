# API Contracts: UI/CSS Enhancements

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Feature**: UI/CSS Enhancements

## Overview

This feature is purely frontend UI enhancements with no backend API changes. Therefore, no API contracts are required.

## Component Contracts

Component prop interfaces and type definitions are documented in `data-model.md` in the parent directory.

## Animation Contracts

Animation configuration types and interfaces are documented in `data-model.md`.

## Font Contracts

Font configuration is handled via Next.js `next/font/google` and CSS variables. No API contracts needed.

## Future Considerations

If backend integration is added in the future (e.g., animation preferences stored in user profile, font preferences API), API contracts will be added here.
